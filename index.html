            <ul>
                <li>Hi! Thank you for visiting my Portfolio, my name is Corbin Johns, and i am at 22 year old coding bootcamp student at MSU.</li>
                <li>I live on my own, and work full time while attending class, it's not easy, but it's something i want to do.</li>
                <li>In my little free time, i like to go for walks, play video games, I love to swim, and my animals mean the world to me.</li>
                <li>I have one dog, named Sergio who is currently 4 years old. I got him back when he was only a 4 month old pup in June of 2018.</li>
                <li>My two cats are named Tuna and Tina, Tuna is a chonky tuxedo cat, and Tina is a small little calico cat. They are best friends and always love on each other and play all day. I got Tuna back in March when i moved, and Tina in August, both in 2022. I used to live in an old farm house with terrible (AWFUL) internet connection.. I'm talking 200kb/s... on a good day.. but stray cats would always just show up, and that's how i wound up with these two.</li>
                <li></li>
                <li>But this isn't an about my animals section, so let's turn this back around.</li>
                <li>Although i am new to all of this, I am having a lot of fun with it. I'm still just learning, but i am confident that my skills will continue to prove over time, and making this page really helped a lot with that too.</li>
                <li>I'm picking up new skills everyday, and i am having a lot of fun with it.</li>
                <li>So, please enjoy my fully functioning Portfolio. üòÅ</li>
            </ul>
